## Exercises

> 1\. Read `man ls` and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner:
> 
> - Includes all files, including hidden files
> - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
> - Files are ordered by recency
> - Output is colorized
> 
> A sample output would look like this:

```
 -rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
 drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
 -rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
 -rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
 drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..
```

```bash
ls -Gahlt
```

- `-G` - Enable colorized output.
- `-a` - Include all files, including hidden files.
- `-h` - List sizes in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954).
- `-l` - List in long format (show permissions, ownership, size, and modification date).
- `-t` - Sort files by recency.

> 2\. Write bash functions `marco` and `polo` that do the following. Whenever you execute `marco`
the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, 
no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`. 
For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell 
by executing `source marco.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

marco() {
  MARCO_DIR=$(pwd)
  export MARCO_DIR
}

polo() {
  cd $MARCO_DIR
}
```
